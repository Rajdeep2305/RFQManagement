                Ensure that validation checks are in place to verify required

                Consult with your IT team to set up API connections or data
                export/import tools to sync data between the RFQ software and
                your ERP or CRM systems. Most RFQ tools offer integration guides

                Use the RFQ softwareâ€™s dashboard to monitor the status of all
                active RFQs. It should display the submission, approval, and
                vendor response stages in real-time, allowing for easy tracking
                of each RFQ's progress.

              <p>
                The software should implement encryption protocols for data in
                transit and at rest. Additionally, user permissions should be
                configured to limit access to sensitive data based on roles and
                responsibilities.

                Most RFQ tools provide a comparison table feature that displays
                the vendor quotations side by side, allowing you to filter and
                compare prices, terms, and other relevant details to help you
                make an informed decision.

                Check if the software offers automation rules and templates to
                streamline your RFQ process. You can configure automated
                responses for certain actions, such as acknowledging receipt or
                confirming an RFQ submission, and create reusable templates for
                common RFQs.

                Reports typically include vendor performance, RFQ status, quote
                comparisons, and historical trends. These reports help analyze
                your RFQ process, identify bottlenecks, and make better
                data-driven decisions.
